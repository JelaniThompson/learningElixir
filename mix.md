# Mix
Mix divides our code up into many files to make it more managable

### To generate your project's folder structure and boilerplate, run:
```
mix new example
```

### Mix usually compiles your changes on its own, but when explicitly compiling is necessary, run:
```
mix compile
```
#### When a project is compiled, Mix will create an `_build` directory with the application inside as `example.app`
